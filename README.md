> Two player game to target the opponent airplane.


My submission for [GitHub Game Off 2016](https://github.com/blog/2274-game-off-theme-announcement). :video_game:

This is a game we were playing as kids on math paper. It was a lot of fun during those years to play it. But now, we can play it in the browser! :rocket:

## How to play :zap:

It's a two player game, so you have to find someone to play it with. :smile:

Open the [game in your browser](https://ionicabizau.github.io/airplane-game/) and you will get a unique url you can share with your friend you want to play the game with.

Set the position of your airplane and start attacking the opponent map positions. You don't see their airplane and they don't see yours.

The goal is to hit the opponent's airplane cabin. The one that does it first, will win.
